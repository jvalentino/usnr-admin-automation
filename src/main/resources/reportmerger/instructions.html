<h1>Report Merger</h1>

<p>The purpose of this tool is to combine member data from the following locations:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>NRRM Smart Ruad</b>: Get an XLS file from exporting the NRRM SmartRaud, open it in Excel, and save it in XSLX format.</li>
	<li><b>NRRM IMR</b>: Get the CSV file from exporting the Indivudal Medical Readiness for your unit on NRRM.</li>
	<li><b>FLTMPS GMT Report</b>: Get the XLS file from export GMT status on FLTMPS, open it in Excel, and save it in XSLX format</li>
	<li><b>FLTMPS e-Learning Report</b>: Get the XLS file from export e-Learning status on FLTMPS, open it in Excel, and save it in XSLX format</li>
	<li><b>FLTMPS Individual Augmentee Report</b>: Get the XLS file from export IA status on FLTMPS, open it in Excel, and save it in XSLX format</li>
	<li><b>Manual Inputs</b>: An XLSX file containing manual unit inputs, kept in the PII section of SharePoint</li>
</ul>

<p>Combining all of these reports will result in two things::</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Generated Individual Member Action Plan.pdf</b>: A member-per-page printout that specifies all actions that a member needs 
	to take in terms of e-Learning courses, GMT courses, medical status, AT plans, clearance, and more.</li>
	<li><b>Generated Unit Tracker.xls</b>: A single spreadsheet that uses one member per row to list all information in a single place.</li>
