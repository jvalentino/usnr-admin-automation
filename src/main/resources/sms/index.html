<h1>Mass Message Sender</h1>

<p>This tool can be used to send email and text messages to any individual or group of individuals
that is defined in <b>Manual Unit Inputs.xlsx</b>.</p>

<p>This tool evolved out of a need to quickly make content with unit members, in which text messaging
proved to be most effective means. Later the input was changed to take the spreadsheet used in the 
<b>Report Merger</b> application known as <b>Manual Unit Inputs.xlsx</b>, which contains first name, last name,
rank/rate, and cell #, and any number of email addresses. Later the <b>Report Merger</b> application
had SMS abilities added to it using the services written for this application, and then email abilities.
The SMS and Email functionality was unified and made into a series of reusable components and services.</p>
