<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>This application is a collection of tools written to automate various administrative activities with in the USNR.
It is not officially sponsored and does not store any information, transmit any information, or host any information
online. All data must be supplied locally in order to comply with PII and DISA guidelines. <b>All tools in this application
simply automate the activities of a human being on that human being's computer, using only the resources that human being
has access to on that computer</b>.</p>

<p>This application is a desktop application, meaning that it executes on your local machine. It is not a 
website or web application and stores nothing online.</p>

<h1>How?</h1>

<p>This tool suite is a throw back to the era of the desktop application. While it would make more sense to
build yet-another-web-application using the latest in cloud technologies, there are rules and regulations
around storing and operating these systems when dealing with FOUO and PII data. A desktop application
runs locally, stores locally, and in this case must have data supplied to it locally. Most importantly is solves
a current need now, and can be easily modified.</p>

	<li>Every time reports are generated a new column for the current date will be
	added to the <b>Historical</b> tab. </li>
	<li>This was done so that you can see training percentages over time for whatever period
	you want to track.</li>
